# entsoeR

entsoeR wraps the [API](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html) from Entso-e.

The API returns some very un-tidy xml files and these are made as tidy as possible. However, the output is still rather complicated as there are nedsted data.frames in list columns.

## Installation

To get an API key, you must follow the instructions [here](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html#_authentication_and_authorisation).

When you have got the API key, it's recommended to save it to your .Renviron file as shown below. The package will search for the key, so you don't have to add it to all your scripts.

```
ENTSOE_PAT = "<ENSTO-E-API-KEY>"

```

You can install entsoeR from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jbaumg/entsoeR")
```

## Example

Basic example on how to use "tsget":

```{r example}
## tsget-function

tsget(type="generation",
          dateseq=seq.POSIXt(as.POSIXct("2015-01-01"),as.POSIXct("2016-12-31"),by="day"),
          documentType = "A74",
          processType = "A16",
          psrType = "B19",
          in_Domain = "10Y1001A1001A83F",
          securityToken = ENTSOE_PAT)
```
